## Using Nix

Assuming that you have `nix` installed, you can run a nix development shell with:
```
nix develop .
```

See [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70766300) in case you run into the following error when calling `gradle build`:
```
Installed Build Tools revision 32.0.0 is corrupted. Remove and install again using the SDK Manager.
```
